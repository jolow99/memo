    "The investor is endowed with \\$1 and can choose to send a fraction `fi` to the trustee (and keep the rest). The investment is multiplied by the factor `mult` before reaching the trustee. The trustee can choose to send back to the investor some fraction `ft` of the multiplied investment (and keep the rest). What should they do?\n",
